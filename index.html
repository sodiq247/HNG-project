                <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
                <p>Over the next two years, I am committed to becoming a proficient full stack developer. My primary focus will be on mastering the following technologies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> I will deepen my understanding of server-side programming with Node.js, enhancing my ability to build scalable and efficient back-end systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>React:</strong> I will hone my skills in React, creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces. This will include gaining expertise in hooks, context API, and advanced component patterns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nuxt.js:</strong> I will explore Nuxt.js to leverage its powerful framework for building universal Vue.js applications, focusing on server-side rendering, static site generation, and seamless development experiences.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition to developing my technical skills, I aim to secure a rewarding remote job at a reputable company. This goal includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Building a Strong Portfolio:</strong> I will work on various projects to showcase my skills and expertise. This will involve contributing to open-source projects, building personal projects, and participating in hackathons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Networking:</strong> I will actively engage in the tech community, attending virtual meetups, joining professional groups, and connecting with industry professionals on platforms like LinkedIn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> I will stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices by attending webinars, taking online courses, and reading relevant literature.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A significant milestone in my journey is to conceptualize and develop a robust bill payment platform. This platform will aim to simplify and streamline the process of paying utility bills for customers. Key features will include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> The platform will have an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Transactions:</strong> Security will be a top priority, with robust measures in place to protect user data and transactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Utility Support:</strong> The platform will support a wide range of utility payments, including electricity, water, gas, and internet bills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Users will receive real-time updates on their payment statuses and notifications for due dates and successful transactions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By focusing on these goals, I am confident that I will not only advance my technical expertise but also achieve significant milestones in my career, contributing to meaningful and impactful projects in the tech industry.</p>
